files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because git is a adaptive code version control, multiple files can relate in programming

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log to see the history of commit

    git diff | grep -B -A "lala" for search a specific word and check its ID
    HEAD : current commit

could break something?
